Working project that allows two players to play tic-tac-toe in terminal window.  To start, simply run ruby.tic_tac_toe.rb.  

Player 1 is always 'x', and player 2 is always 'o'.  Checks to make sure input from each player is valid before making mark.  Checks to make sure the field hasn't already been chosen.  Checks each round for end-game conditions, and if not met, continues until the board is filled when it declares a tie.
